# Introduction to Git and GitHub

Git is a **distributed version control system** that helps developers track changes in their code. GitHub is a **hosting platform** for Git repositories, making it easier to collaborate on projects.

## Why Use Git?

Here are some benefits of using Git:

- Track changes in your code over time
- Collaborate with team members
- Roll back to previous versions if something goes wrong
- Work offline and sync when ready

## Basic Git Commands

You can use the following commands to manage your repository:

```bash
git init           # Initialize a new Git repository
git status         # Check the status of files
git add .          # Stage all files for commit
git commit -m "message"   # Commit staged files
git log            # View commit history
````

## Example Workflow

1. Initialize the repository: `git init`
2. Make some changes to your files.
3. Stage the changes: `git add .`
4. Commit the changes: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`

> **Tip:** Commit often with meaningful messages to make your history easier to understand.
